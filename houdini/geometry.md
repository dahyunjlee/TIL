#Geometry

###Points and Vertices

A *point* is simply a point in space as defined by four numbers (X, Y, Z, W).

A *vertex* is a reference to a point. Primitives use vertices to reference points. For example, the corners of a polygon, the center of a sphere, or a control vertex of a spline curve.

Primitives can share points, while vertices are unique to a primitive.

###Primitives
*Primitives* refer to a unit of geometry, lower-level than an object but above points.
